# MM 2020-10-16 Client Meeting

## Showed Client Current Demo
Replace "any" with "all" for release type in filter panel
If it becomes difficult to create some types of graphs (i.e. stacked bar graph), substitute filter
  Evan said those types of graphs should be easy to create
Possibly switch color of map markers to red

## Next steps
Flesh out graphs
	Find elegant way to show pub chem data
	Nic likes that chemicals are listed when you click facility
	Recommends search for chemical to be one from selecting from listed to pull up pubchem data
	Evan suggests 4th tab for chemical data - Nic suggested showing data inline with the listed
Fix bounding for state search
	Filter records by state, zip code, city, etc. before 
	Nic is ok with minizing what the user is allowed to enter into the system
Add filter for year

## Long Term
Find different (free) API for geocoding

## Showed Nic database schema
	Total Release Water doesn't have subcomponents like Total Release Air
	Discussed total releases vs. total releases on site (excludes offsite releases)
	When visualizing releases we need to use: total air, total watet, total land, total offsite, total
	Suggested replacing M coded fields with precalculated total fields or perform the calculations in the database and then remove M coded fields
	Note and be consistent about using VET total releases or EPA total releases
	Nic approved of database schema, but wants us to document how the calculations are performed
		Calvin created a trigger which sums the columns when they are added to the database
