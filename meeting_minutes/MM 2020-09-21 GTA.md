## Tasks Accomplished Last Week
Talked with client about TRI and PubChem data

Went over data with client

Decided data to pull

## What Does the Data Look Like?
Yearly CSV files back to 1997

Location, toxicant information, spill information, company information

Convert from csv to json

## Overview of Visualization
Geographically first, color coded by hazard presented by chemical


## What is needed for first prototype
Core function should be complete.

Should be able to visualize location of toxicants.

Must contain map to visualize data.

Prototype is essecntially the final product with UI and other elements stripped down

For this prototype: include map with some kind of visualization on it (dots for spill types, etc.)
OR pick a single entry and visualize that.


Think about which of these atributes should be displayed on the map (location and type of toxicant)

Search, sort, filter by toxicants can be prototype 2.



## Action Items
Talk to professor Sayed about the scope of prototype 1.

Talk about this with the client (ask what he expects from prototype 1)
